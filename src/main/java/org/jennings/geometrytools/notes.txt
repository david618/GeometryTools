Flight Simulator Event Server polls servers 
- Web Server interface excepts calls for current position of a plane
- Each Web Server would run simulations for several planes 
- Planes would take off from an airport and travel to another airport
- After a period of time on the ground the plane would continue
- Return id, flight-id, position, speed, direction, and altitude 
- Each server would run a unique set of "planes" 
- The Event Server would poll the server(s) for each plane
