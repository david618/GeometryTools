# GeometryTools
Created to Generate Sample JSON/GeoJSON polygons

This is in development; very rough at this time....

The AllCountries.java class reads in data from GeoNames org http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/.  It adds small polygons around each point and creates an geojson file.  

Goal is to add similar capabilities to create JSON and CSV sample files (suitable for ArcGIS GeoEvent).
